Forks of open source libraries that we've modified, or libraries where some documentation about their usage is required.

## [Bootoast](https://github.com/sightsdev/bootoast-fa)

Modified to use Font Awesome icons instead of Glyphicons

## [gamepad.js](https://github.com/sightsdev/gamepad.js)

Forked from [khanbabaeifanap/HTML5-JavaScript-Gamepad-Controller-Library](https://github.com/khanbabaeifanap/HTML5-JavaScript-Gamepad-Controller-Library)
Which itself was forked from [kallaspriit/HTML5-JavaScript-Gamepad-Controller-Library](https://github.com/kallaspriit/HTML5-JavaScript-Gamepad-Controller-Library)

@khanbabaeifanap's fork fixes an issue that prevented the library from working on modern browsers.
